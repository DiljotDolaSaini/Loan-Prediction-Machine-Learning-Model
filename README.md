# Loan Prediction Machine Learning Model

This project was made to predict a whether an applicant will be able to payback their bank loan, base on various factors. This model was developed by first treating the data and analyzing trends within the data. To treat this data I used various libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and numpy. Then I was able to train the model with a large data set using the sklearn library. This allowed me to then generate a predtion on whether an applicant would be able to pay back their loan, giving an accuracy of the prediction.
